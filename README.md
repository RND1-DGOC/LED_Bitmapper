A simple Python application using Tkinter to simulate an LED panel, allowing users to draw, edit, and generate C++ code for bitmap patterns. Ideal for embedded systems developers working on LED displays, such as P10 panels or custom matrices. This tool helps visualize and export patterns as uint8_t arrays for use in microcontrollers like STM32 or Arduino.
