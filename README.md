 your embedded C projects, modify the LED colors or sizes in create_led_panel() to match hardware like DMD displays.
Best Practices: Test patterns on real hardware (e.g., STM32F407) after exporting. If integrating with cloud data (like your DRM3400 system), consider adding export options for binary formats.
